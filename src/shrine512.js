/**
 * Convenient and extremely easy to use SHA-512 encryption/decryption of strings or objects with a single method for each direction. This is very heavy encryption - and provided something like a 20-character secret key, it should be like (disclaimer: as a figure of speech) 20 eternities before it'd be realstic that a super-computer would brute-force guess your secret passwordkey-thing? Of course it would be less than a second if anyone has your secret key, so don't even THINK it too loudly - because someone could think they heard it - and be right!!! ;) Watch out for key-loggers -> gg. Gluck.

 * If the object has been destroyed, a new key retriever can be created by creating a new object witht the class constructor, and it will not be the same key-getter function exactly, but it will decrypt just as well.
